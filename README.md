# Custom built HTTP server

I've been using services such as Ruby on Rails and Express.js for years, and realised I do not understand many of the fundamentals going on under the hood.
In order to mitigate this blind spot, I've implemented an HTTP server from scratch without any external libraries.

There are no tests because the goal of this repo is not to write production level code. Instead, the goal is deepen my understanding of how HTTP works on a (more) fundamental level.

Please to not assess this repo as indicitive of my professional approach to engineering. It does however represent my desire to constantly learn and improve my understanding of software engineering.
