# Custom built HTTP server

I've been using services such as Ruby on Rails and Express.js for years, and realised I do not understand many of the fundamentals going on under the hood.
In order to mitigate this blind spot, I've implemented an HTTP server from scratch without any external libraries.

There are no tests because the goal of this repo is not to write production level code. Instead, the goal is deepen my understanding of how the web works.

This project was based on the awesome courses for senior engineers at codecrafters, however I've expanded the core functionality further.
